Dictionary of products and their stock quantities
stock = {
    "Apples": 25,
    "Bananas": 12,
    "Oranges": 8,
    "Mangoes": 15,
    "Pineapples": 5

3️⃣ Function to return products with stock less than 10
`python
def lowstockproducts(stock_dict):
    return [product for product, qty in stock_dict.items() if qty < 10]

`
