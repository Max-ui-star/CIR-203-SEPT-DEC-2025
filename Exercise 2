1️⃣ Create a list of 10 delivery routes
`python
routes = [
    "Nairobi-CBD",
    "Mombasa-Port",
    "Kisumu-Lake",
    "Nakuru-Highway",
    "Eldoret-Airport",
    "Nyeri-Town",
    "Thika-Road",
    "Naivasha-Industrial",
    "Kericho-Tea",
    "Malindi-Beach"
]

print("Initial routes:", routes)
`

2️⃣ Append a new route and remove a discontinued one
`python

Append new route
routes.append("Garissa-Market")

Remove discontinued route (example: "Malindi-Beach")
routes.remove("Malindi-Beach")

print("Updated routes:", routes)
`

---

3️⃣ Sort alphabetically and reverse
`python
routes.sort()       # Sort alphabetically
routes.reverse()    # Reverse order

print("Sorted & reversed routes:", routes)
`7

---

4️⃣ Count how many routes start with “N”
`python
count_N = sum(1 for r in routes if r.startswith("N"))
print("Routes starting with 'N':", count_N)
`

---

5️⃣ List comprehension for routes longer than 10 characters
`python
long_routes = [r for r in routes if len(r) > 10]
print("Routes longer than 10 characters:", long_routes)
`
